## **Project Description**:

### Project Has been Divided In Two-Phase

___
### Stage 1: 
>1.Nevigation at home page

>2.**Feature Extraction**[where User Can Extract/ask for similar pattern under their specification]

>3.**Face On Trial** where user can take trial using their camera & cloth they select[it is an augmented reality dressing room where the image of the user is captured by 
the camera and given as an input]

---
### Stage 2:
>1.**3D model Creation** [using PIFuHD Model]

>2.**Rendering of 3D model** into human model and size/measurement extraction[using Unity & Blender]

>3.Providing **Virtual Trial Room** Feature to the user to try on the cloth

>>i) if the size measurement of the person and cloth matches, the trial model will be generated. otherwise, it will show "size not matched", ask the user to change selected clothes.
